      content: `spending today on three things:

- fastai course
- leetcode
- recording a script

i'll finish up the video i was working on before about reimplementing papers, then finish up the script i'm working on.
i haven't even brushed my teeth yet. been busy with emails. should probably get on that.

(2:48pm) starting the fastai course now.

(3:15pm) this course is pretty dogshit. i'm better off using my time reading papers and reimplementing them.
will go ahead and do that now.

(3:44pm) finished up some work Word2Vec. will go ahead and record the script i've been sitting on for a while now.

(12:47am) update: ended up recording four videos. batch recording is a godsend.
the current workflow is as follows:

- record
- script
- spend the rest of the week editing videos

i got 4 videos done, but i'm almost certain i could have done more. maybe even 7.
the thing is, too: i'm proud of the videos i did do. they're good. very good.

![batch recording](https://i.postimg.cc/Kvyb2g2x/image.png)

posted a new [video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKDnh0kM48w/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) today.
i'm proud of it. it represents a new shift in how i want to post on instagram.

i'll be doing a lot more of this. posting about research, papers, and all that good stuff.

i'm gonna spend the rest of the night working on leetcode, but before i do that, i've a letter to write.

(2:06am) finished the letter, finished a new video, but i'm conked out.

going to bed now.

(4:41pm) working on leetcode now.
      
finished a problem:

- Binary Search (Easy)

![soln](https://i.postimg.cc/hPqXVdQk/image.png)

(9:43pm) spent the day at uni, didn't get much work done.

i'll be doing a seminar on leetcode in a few minutes,
but after that i'll be working on this fastai course.

i'd better get on posting reels and getting into the flow of things.
it's rather frustrating that i'm finding myself at the end of days, with 0 progress and nothing to show for it.

all that tells me is that i lack urgency.
i'm pretty sure i can come up with a list of reasons why.

i'm more than capable of being where i want to be; i just need to be willing to put in the work. 
i can define three categories that need to be addressed in my career:

- leetcode (for interview prep)
- research (for my own knowledge, and for the sake of my own projects)
- content creation (personal brand)

tackling all of these is more than possible. 
i just need time by myself. time in the workshop, time in the lab, time in the library, time in the field.

this is the first time i've felt like i'm on the right track in a while. 
there's a very obvious reason for that. 
but i'm still not where i want to be. 
i'm right there. i'm so fucking close to where i want to be i can taste it.

tomorrow's saturday. i'll be at it all day. tonight, i'll go ahead and finish up this fastai course, then work on some leetcode some more. it's 

it's times like these that i need to remind myself that i love computer science, 
and i'll be damned if i'm not going to make something of myself.
i feel that what has me letting me off the accelerator is i know exactly what i need to do.
the path ahead is clear as day.

now it's just up to me to execute.

i've been handed a golden ticket, and i'm not about to let it slip through my fingers.

(1:02am) working on the fastai course now.

      content: `spent the day working on this website.

not sure how much more i can do to it. will have to update the 'projects' and 'writing' sections with their respective content.

need to fix the calendar to show the correct dates, and make everything look a bit cleaner.

(9:22pm) gonna spend the rest of the night working on this website, then go do some leetcode/neetcode.

i'm thinking of doing a 'what i've been up to' series of posts on instagram.

i'll have to think about it some more.

(12:15am) leetcode time.

- 206. Reverse Linked List (Easy)

![RLL Soln](https://i.postimg.cc/vZK77Zgs/image.png)

---

- 23. Merge K Sorted Lists (Hard)

![MKSOLN](https://i.postimg.cc/sDRPv6B4/image.png)

the first problem was rather easy, with the second one being a bit of a struggle. i'm not sure why.

creating a helper function to merge two lists was a good idea. thought of that first, but the implementation of the merge later on was slightly more tricky to think of.

(1:38am) going to go ahead and finish up a script.

![script](https://i.postimg.cc/rmX0VLkk/image.png)

finished a couple of script ideas. got 20 reels locked in.

the series of reimplementing papers is something i'm thinking of doing.

gonna have to implement a couple of foundational papers first for that one to work out. i'll get on that when i wake up tomorrow.

for now, i'm gonna go ahead and sleep.

it's 10:53pm and i still haven't started neetcode/leetcode. why?

i'm too lazy to get up from my seat, go downstairs, and grab my ipad to take notes on.

writing that out made me realize how stupid that sounds. give me a sec..

- (10:56pm) i'm back. time to get to work.

- (11:33pm) finished "1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch," an easy leetcode problem.

current priority should be finishing up this fastAI course (pt1 & 2).

it seems to have every concept you need to progress further in AI/ML.

she's sick right now but in my mind we're holding hands as she gets better. i'm not gonna slow down.

i feel like my work right now is a sacrifice to God so she feels better in the morning.

easy enough

- posted tweet
- wrote script, recording tomorrow

how do i write an instagram script about something as boring as research?

probably through recording what i do daily. it'll be boring but probably useful for a lot of people. 

"summer's a time to relax and have fun, but unfortunately for me both of those come in the form of studying even harder."

mid day.

no leetcode, no neetcode, 0 research, 0 work on mathemaâ€¦

but at least i got a post down. and its my favorite post ever. also posted on twitter as well. gotta make that more of an easy, daily thing. i suppose *daily* posts on twitter just means a high-quality post, like a paper analysis or whatever.

might have to start a blog website. like, pranav.me or some shit.`

worked on annotating a research paper i found on the front-page of PapersWithCode: FastVLM: Efficient Vision Encoding for Vision Language Models. i'll attach my annotations here shortly.

besides that, i finished up some more of this course (AWS ML Specialist). booooooring but it finishes my "exploratory reading" task. it's 8:37pm right now: i'll finish up some leetcode/neetcode prep, quickly make a post on twitter, and do some linear algebra.

didn't work on mathema in the slightest. bummer

---

made a quick pipeline to most basic research papers:
	
1. data

2. model

    a. class that inherits from nn.Module

    b. define layers in __init__()

    c. forward() method

3. loss function

    a. nn.MSELoss

    b. nn.CrossEntropyLoss

    c. nn.BCELoss

4. optimizer

    a. torch.optim.sgd

    b. torch.optim.Adam

5. training loop

    a. make prediction, compute loss

    b. backpropagation

    c. update weights
    
6. evaluation

    a. accuracy, BLEU, F1, perplexity, etc.

finished neetcode prep:
- Dynamic Arrays
- Singly Linked Lists

re-doing neetcode is pretty embarrassing, but i guess it's never a bad thing to review foundations & first principles. time complexity is something i struggle remembering, so at the very least i got to review that.

finished leetcode problems:
- Merge Two Sorted Lists (1)
- Reverse Linked List (2)

these two problems were rather easy. the first problem (1) was a slight struggle, but i got it in the end. i'm pretty rusty

will post on twitter about the paper in a bit. gonna go play spider-man w/ the fam now
